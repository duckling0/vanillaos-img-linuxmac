**Installation Instructions**
-------------

**prerequisites**
Enure the necessary packages are installed:


**fedora package install**
```
dnf install dkms gcc kernel-devel make wget
```
**ubuntu package install**
```
 apt install dkms gcc make linux-headers-generic wget
```
**arch package install**
```
pacman -S dkms gcc make linux-headers wget
```
1. **build and install dkms module** (experimental feature)  
this will build the module for the current/active kernel  
and will auto-compile this module whenever you install a newer kernel  
```
git clone https://github.com/leifliddy/macbook12-bluetooth-driver.git
cd macbook12-bluetooth-driver/
# run the following command as root or with sudo
./install.bluetooth.sh -i

# to uninstall the dkms feature run:
./install.bluetooth.sh -u
```

2. (backup method if dkms didn't work) **manually build and install module for current kernel**
```
git clone https://github.com/leifliddy/macbook12-bluetooth-driver.git
cd macbook12-bluetooth-driver/
# run the following command as root or with sudo
./install.bluetooth.sh
reboot
```

```install.bluetooth.sh``` will auto-patch the ```hci_bcm.c``` source file and then compile and install the ```hci_uart``` module

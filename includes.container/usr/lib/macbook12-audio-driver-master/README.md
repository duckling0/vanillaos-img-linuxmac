Work in progress audio driver for the 12" MacBook that's largely based on davidjo's [snd_hda_macbookpro](https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro)

**macbooks supported**:
MacBook9,1 (2016) and Macbook10,1 (2017)  
Note: the Macbook8,1 (2015) is not supported

**Kernels supported**:
\>= 5.0

Compiling and installing driver:
-------------

**fedora package install**
```
dnf install dkms gcc kernel-devel make wget
```
**ubuntu package install**
```
apt install dkms gcc linux-headers-generic make wget
```
**arch package install**
```
pacman -S dkms gcc linux-headers make wget
```
1. **build and install dkms module** (experimental feature)  
this will build the module for the current/active kernel  
and will auto-compile this module whenever you install a newer kernel  
```
git clone https://github.com/leifliddy/macbook12-audio-driver.git
cd macbook12-audio-driver/
# run the following command as root or with sudo
./install.cirrus.driver.sh -i
reboot

# to uninstall the dkms feature run:
./install.cirrus.driver.sh -u
```

2. (backup method if dkms didn't work) **manually build and install module for current kernel**
```
git clone https://github.com/leifliddy/macbook12-audio-driver.git
cd macbook12-audio-driver/
# run the following command as root or with sudo
./install.cirrus.driver.sh
reboot
```
